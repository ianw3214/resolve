# RESOLVE

Resolve is a game I started with the intention of learning javascript. As of right now, I will not be working on the project anymore for a number of reasons.

- Life is too busy with full time job + class + band + other obligations
- Game is not even fun to play
- I don't like level design, and I am now at the point where that is a main part of the game

It is ironic that I have no resolve towards this project :(
